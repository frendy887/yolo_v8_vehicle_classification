# 🚢 Ferry Vehicle Detection and Classification with YOLOv8

This project utilizes **YOLOv8m** from the **Ultralytics** library to detect and classify vehicles for ticketing purposes on ferry transportation. It identifies vehicle types such as cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles from the **COCO dataset**.

## 🔍 Overview

The project uses **YOLOv8m** for object detection and classification of vehicles entering a ferry boarding station. The goal is to automate ticket management based on vehicle types detected in a real-time video stream or image input.

**Key Vehicle Classes** (from COCO dataset):  
- 🚗 Car  
- 🚚 Truck  
- 🛵 Motorcycle  
- 🚌 Bus  

The detected vehicle dimensions (in pixels) are converted to real-world measurements to assist in ticket classification.

## ✨ Features

- **Vehicle Detection**: Real-time detection of vehicles using YOLOv8m.  
- **Classification**: Classifies vehicles into specific categories (e.g., car, truck, bus, motorcycle).  
- **Bounding Box Metrics**: Calculates pixel width of the bounding box and converts it to meters.  
- **Easy Integration**: Built with Python and Ultralytics for ease of deployment.  
- **Customizable**: Scalable for other YOLO versions and datasets.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Ultralytics  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ferry-vehicle-detection.git
   cd ferry-vehicle-detection
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. **Download YOLOv8m model**:
   - The pre-trained YOLOv8m model can be downloaded from [Ultralytics YOLOv8 Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
   - Save it in the project directory as `yolov8m.pt`.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Run the detection script**:
   Use the following command to process an image or video:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --source path/to/your/video_or_image --weights yolov8m.pt
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --source test_video.mp4 --weights yolov8m.pt
   ```

2. **Optional Arguments**:
   - `--source`: Path to the input video/image.  
   - `--weights`: Path to the YOLOv8 model file.  
   - `--conf`: Confidence threshold for detection (default: 0.25).  

3. **Output**:
   - The processed video or image will be saved in the `runs/detect` folder with bounding boxes and vehicle classifications.

## 🔮 Future Work

- Add a real-world calibration feature for more accurate size estimation.  
- Integrate a database to store detection results for ticket management.  
- Deploy the system on edge devices like Raspberry Pi for real-time use.
